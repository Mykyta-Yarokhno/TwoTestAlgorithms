# Algorithms in C# and JavaScript

This repository contains two algorithms:
1. **C#:** A program to solve the Hedgehog color-changing problem.
2. **JavaScript:** A validator for Sudoku solutions.

## Description

- **C#:** This algorithm solves the problem of making all hedgehogs the same color. Given an initial population of hedgehogs in three colors, the goal is to find the minimum number of meetings required for all hedgehogs to become the target color. The algorithm checks for edge cases where this isn't possible.
  
- **JavaScript:** This algorithm checks if a given Sudoku board is a valid solution. The board must be a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, and all rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids must contain unique numbers from 1 to 9.
